            Views are vader components which are used to display content to the user. They help you organize your webapp
            into different page files, while also allowing you to embed them in one another.
            Views use the <span class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">src/</span> directory and can be included in
            other views using the <span class="badge text-blue-500 badge-ghost">&lt;include/&gt;</span> tag.
            Alternatively their is a <span class="text-purple-500">include()</span> function to include views inside of
            your top level js files!
        </p>
        <p class="prose">
            They offer remarkable flexibility, treating your content consistently whether it's written in Markdown or HTML. Your at no limitation to what you can write or do inside of then!

        </p>

            After defining routes to your pages - vader looks for relative links for example <span
                class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">/about</span> and <span
                class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">/contact</span> are valid links to your pages.
            These will be changed to <span class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">#/about.html</span> and <span
                class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">#/contact.html</span> respectively.
        </p>

         <p>
           Vader uses relative paths because often times it can be hard indexing folders. in a webapp - so vader uses relative paths to both the root public folder and the root src folder.
           These two folders are required to be in the root of your project.

        <div class="p-5 border-l-blue-500 flex flex-col border-l-4">

            **Note**
            <p>
                You can disable relative paths - using <span class="badge badge-ghost"> #vader_disable_relative-paths
                </span> comment at the top of your file.

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold">Javascript</h1>
        <p>
            Views have two ways of using js in your project views  - we have the component scope script entity $&#123;&#125; and you can run js after rendered to dom using the <script></script> tag
