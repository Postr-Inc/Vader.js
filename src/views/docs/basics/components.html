            Vader components are the building blocks of your webapp. Components are reusable and can be embedded into
            other components. Their are two types of components
            .vjs - vader javascript view components often used to hold your webpages content. And .js regular class
            based components used to define page logic and state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vader components often times may just hold your state logic for other components, or other times
            may be the single main component for your webpage. Vader is flexible and can be used for many different
            use cases.

                Vader.Component

            Only the render method is required for a component to be valid.
            the other methods are optional per your projects needs.

        <markdown>

            - **render()**: The render method is responsible for generating HTML content for the component. You can
            customize this method to define your component's visual representation.

            - **componentDidMount()**: This method is called explicitly when the component is mounted. It's not handled
            directly by Vader; you need to manually call it when needed in your component. You can use it to perform
            actions after the component has been added to the DOM.

       <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Component Lifecycle's</h1>

        <p class="mt-5">
            Vader.js provides several lifecycle methods that you can override to handle different events throughout the
            component's lifecycle:

        <markdown class="list-inside prose gap-4 mt-8 mb-5">
            The <span class="badge badge-ghost">componentUpdated</span> method is an overrideable method that is called
            by Vader when the component's content has changed.
            It receives three arguments:

        </markdown>
        <p class="mt-2 break-words ">
            - <span class="badge badge-ghost">prev_states</span> An object representing the previous instance of the
            component's state before it changed.

            - <span class="badge badge-ghost">prev_props</span>: An object representing the previous instance of the
            component's props before they changed.

            - <span class="badge badge-ghost">snapshot</span>: An object representing the last full snapshot of the
            component.
        </p>

        <markdown class="text-lg font-bold badge mt-5 mb-5 badge-ghost text-blue-500">
            ### componentWillUnmount()
        </markdown>
        - The <span class="badge badge-ghost">componentWillUnmount</span>
        method is an overrideable method that is called by Vader when <span class="badge badge-ghost">
            Vader.Component.unmount()</span> is called.
        <br>

        - This method allows you to specify logic that should run when the component is about to be unmounted from the
        DOM. It's useful for performing cleanup tasks before the component is removed.
