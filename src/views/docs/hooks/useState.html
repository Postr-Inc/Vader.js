            Views are vader components which are used to display content to the user. They help you organize your webapp
            into different page files, while also allowing you to embed them in one another.
            Views use the <span class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">src/</span> directory and can be included in
            other views using the <span class="badge text-blue-500 badge-ghost">&lt;include/&gt;</span> tag.
            Alternatively their is a <span class="text-purple-500">include()</span> function to include views inside of
            your top level js files!
        </p>
        <p class="prose">
            There are no limitations to what you can write inside view files. Most of the documentation you have read
            about Vader is written in both HTML and Markdown. Vader transpiles Markdown code inside your HTML/VJS files.

            Furthermore, these view files are returned as functions, which means you can incorporate JavaScript within
            them using the following syntax:


            <span class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500"> &#36; &#123; &#125; </span>


            This syntax allows you to dynamically include JavaScript code within your views, enhancing their
            functionality and interactivity.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Link Between Views</h1>

        <p>
            After defining routes to your pages - vader looks for relative links for example <span
                class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">/about</span> and <span
                class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">/contact</span> are valid links to your pages.
            These will be changed to <span class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">#/about.html</span> and <span
                class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">#/contact.html</span> respectively.
        </p>

        <div class="p-5 border-l-blue-500 flex flex-col border-l-4">

            **Note**
            <p>
                You can disable relative paths - using <span class="badge badge-ghost"> #vader_disable_relative-paths
                </span> comment at the top of your file.
