            Vader is not a replacement for react / next.js / vue.js / svelte.js / etc. Vader is client sided and is not meant for server side rendering.
            If your project requires server side rendering, vader is not for you.

        <p>Performance is our top priority. Many websites suffer from slowness due to excessive JavaScript usage. Why should we have to call the 'document' each time we want to edit an element or split our code into multiple files, each hundreds of lines long?</p>
        <p>This is where Vader shines. With Vader, you write less and focus on accomplishing more. Vader renders content based on what's in your HTML, and it comes with built-in caching to ensure your site navigates faster.</p>
        <p>Vader also introduces a new concept called        <span class="badge badge-ghost text-blue-500">CFR</span> - Client Fly Rendering, a novel way to render content on your webpage. It manipulates elements on a worker thread and updates the content according to what the user is viewing. This approach keeps the main thread free, allowing for a smoother user experience.</p>

           >Easy to use</h2>
           <p class="prose">
            <p> Vader's primary objective is to provide open accessibility to every developer. It doesn't impose any strict, specific methodology or approach; instead, it empowers you to decide how you want to use it.</p>
         
             <p>During the design phase of Vader, the focus was on simplifying the transition for developers coming from the React ecosystem into a new environment that follows similar principles, albeit in a more explicit and verbose manner.</p>
           
           <p>  In other words, if you're familiar with React, you'll find that Vader is designed to feel familiar and adhere to the same core principles. However, it also aims to provide more transparency and clarity, making it easier for you to understand and work within this new ecosystem. </p>
           <p>This approach ensures that developers can leverage their existing knowledge while embracing a slightly different but still intuitive paradigm offered by Vader.</p>
